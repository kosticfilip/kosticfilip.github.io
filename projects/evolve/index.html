          <h3 class="text-center">Basic Info</h3>
          <p>
            The web platform is currently in beta. I started doing this as a
            side project, working full-stack. My idea was to make something
            affordable for freelancers and teams who need to gather feedback and
            keep their projects organized.
          </p>

            It supports image & pdf annotations and notes, tracking and managing
            all revisions untill final approval, <i>Tree View</i> - simple
            overview and whole project presentation.

          <p>
            Platform was built using <i>MERN</i> stack and it is hosted on AWS
            cloud. It supports drag and drop file uploads, auto creation of
            revisions for the files with same names, grouping and reordering
            files, project invites by email. Most of the funcionality is
            available on mobile phones too.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've tried to minimize the usage of react plugins, and make most of
            components myself - <i>annotations & notes</i>,
            <i>file uploading widget</i>, <i>revisions stack carousel</i>,
            <i>common elements</i> (input, drop-down, modal, loading
            animations).

          <h3 class="text-center">Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Experience doing something like this was overall great. Making
            database models, express server, file uploading service for aws,
            emails, error handling, auth... and connecting all of that with
            react app was really a lot of work, often with frustrating moments
            at the beginning, but in the end, it is very satisfying to see it
            all working together.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of things which need more work, and some features I
            would like to implement, but overall I'm very pleased with the
            results. Most importantly, I feel like I learned a lot, and improved
            my coding skills but huge amount over the past six months making
            this.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the UI & UX perspective, I'm really amazed with potential of
            react app, coupled with great performance, nice animation
            implementation, smooth transitions and loading states - The final
            result feels almost like a native app. üëç
